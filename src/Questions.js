           <h4>Common Car Problem Prevalent</h4>
           <p>Well, Many Cities has everything at its peak whether  it is warm summers or harsh and chilly winters. Air
             Conditioning is one of the major problems faced in the scorching heat, the compressor oil
             
             needs to be topped-up regularly to help protect the unit and there are regular coolant leaks also dust and
             dirt can cause the system to overload and malfunction. Despite that tyres are one of the most neglected parts
             of a car. Poor tyre-pressure management on a hot day could destroy your sidewall since the softer rubber is
             more prone to damage. On poor roads, this could even result in the tyres bursting, Followed by the battery
             situation in winters you need to put some extra pressure on the engine to make it warm, doing it excessively
             
             can reduce the battery life by causing the fluid inside to evaporate quicker. It even speeds up the chemical
             reaction inside a battery, leading to overcharging.
